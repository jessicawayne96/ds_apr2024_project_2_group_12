For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

**Instructions**
The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

Create the ERD Diagram Outlining the Database

Transform the given two xlsx files into four usable csvs for database import

Create and import data into PGAdmin 

Load the database in python and perform a few queries and display at least 2 visualizations
